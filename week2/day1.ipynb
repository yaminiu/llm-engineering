       "\n",
       "A worm gnaws perpendicularly to the pages from the first page of the first volume to the last page of the second volume. That means it starts at the very beginning of the pages in Volume 1 (i.e., at the inner face of the front cover of Volume 1, if the pages are oriented with the first page touching the front cover) and ends at the very end of the pages in Volume 2 (i.e., at the inner face of the back cover of Volume 2).\n",
       "\n",
       "Crucial detail: when books sit side by side, the space between the first page of Volume 1 and the last page of Volume 2 is not simply the sum of the page thicknesses, because the front cover of Volume 1 and the back cover of Volume 2 lie between the two sets of pages in the stacked arrangement.\n",
       "\n",
       "What the worm actually traverses:\n",
       "- It starts at the first page of Volume 1, which is adjacent to the inner face of Volume 1’s front cover.\n",
       "- To reach the last page of Volume 2, it must pass through:\n",
       "  - The inner front cover of Volume 1 (0.2 cm),\n",
       "  - The pages of Volume 1 (2 cm),\n",
       "  - The internal gap between the two books? No gap: the volumes are touching side by side, so there is no space between Volume 1 and Volume 2 along the shelf wall. The worm can pass directly from Volume 1 into Volume 2 by going through the shared common boundary at the adjacent faces between the volumes.\n",
       "  - Then the inner back cover of Volume 2 (0.2 cm),\n",
       "  - And finally into the last page region of Volume 2 (needs to traverse through the pages of Volume 2 to reach the last page, which is at the outer boundary of the pages adjacent to the back cover).\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the classic trick in this puzzle is to realize that “distance through” the worm travels is equal to the thickness of the shelf region that lies between the very first page of Volume 1 and the very last page of Volume 2, which turns out to be simply the sum of the page thicknesses of both volumes plus one cover thickness (the two facing covers between them) minus the two outer covers that are not between the first page of V1 and last page of V2.\n",
       "\n",
       "But a simpler and standard resolution is:\n",
       "- The worm starts at the first page of Volume 1, which is right after the front cover of Volume 1.\n",
       "- The worm finishes at the last page of Volume 2, which is right before the back cover of Volume 2.\n",

       "- Through Volume 1: the remainder of Volume 1’s pages and the back cover of Volume 1 if the starting point is at the very first page (which is immediately after the front cover). That means it traverses the rest of Volume 1’s pages (2 cm total pages, so from first page to the end of Volume 1’s pages is almost 2 cm, but since it starts at the first page, it must traverse almost all 2 cm of Volume 1’s pages: effectively 2 cm).\n",
       "- Then through the adjacent region between the volumes: there is no gap, so nothing extra.\n",
       "- Through Volume 2: from the start of Volume 2’s pages to the last page is the full 2 cm of Volume 2’s pages.\n",
